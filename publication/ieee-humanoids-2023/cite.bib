  abstract = {The cases of musculoskeletal diseases in workplaces like industrial warehouses and healthcare units is rapidly increasing. The ergoCub project aims to introduce a new humanoid robot platform for ergonomic human-robot collaborations in such workplaces in order to mitigate the risks on the health of the workers. This article presents the mechanical design and development of a new compact and powerful joint module for the forthcoming version of ergoCub 2.0. The proposed joint achieves continuous torque of 40.5 N m, repeatable peak torque of 77.5 N m, thus increasing the torque density by 163\% and the power density by 61\% as compared to the current joints. Additionally, the digital twin of the joint is presented and the simulations for sensorless torque estimation are demonstrated.},
