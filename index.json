For this, several Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKMs) were considered, namely a 4-UU mechanism, a spherical 5-bar mechanism and a spherical 6-bar mechanism, with gimbal-like rotations. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) modelling and simulations exploring the workspaces for each of these mechanisms was performed. The complete workspace and isotropy analyses comparing these mechanisms to a gimbal system are presented. The general observations suggest that these mechanisms posses a non-uniform workspace with a \"warping\" behaviour. However, the spherical six bar mechanism proves to be the best solution so far with isotropy nearly = 0.9 throughout its workspace.","tags":["parallel kinematic mechanisms","computer-aided design","humanoids"],"title":"Comparison of Workspace Analysis for Different Spherical Parallel Mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to download the slides presented at the conference.

These characteristics make them ideal for applications in robot wrists. This article presents the detailed kinematic and workspace analysis for four N-UU class mechanisms. More in detail, the equations defining the mechanism’s moving platform kinematics are derived as a function of the motion of the input links; these are then used to explore the mechanism’s workspace. These results are furthermore validated by comparing them to the results obtained from CAD-based simulations. The analyses suggests that the workspace of the mechanism is non-uniform, with a “warping” behaviour that occurs in an asymmetric fashion in a specific region of the workspace. Furthermore we show how the rotation of the input links, which mainly actuates the yaw and pitch angles of the mechanism, also causes unwanted coupled rotations along the roll axis.","tags":["parallel kinematic mechanisms","computer-aided design","humanoids"],"title":"Workspace Analysis and the Effect of Geometric Parameters on Parallel Mechanisms of the N-UU Class","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Divya Shah","Ernesto Denicia","Tiago Pimentel","Barbara Bruno","Fulvio Mastrogiovanni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"2c31cf504e2c0fd25a60fc788df07742","permalink":"https://divyashah.github.io/publication/ras-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ras-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Bimanual gestures are of the utmost importance for the study of motor coordination in humans and in everyday activities. A reliable detection of bimanual gestures in unconstrained environments is fundamental for their clinical study and to assess common activities of daily living. This paper investigates techniques for a reliable, unconstrained detection and classification of bimanual gestures. The work assumes the availability of inertial data originating from the two hands arms, builds upon a previously developed technique for gesture modeling based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), and compares different modeling and classification techniques, which are based on a number of assumptions inspired by literature about how bimanual gestures are represented and modeled in the brain. Experiments show results related to 5 everyday bimanual activities, which have been selected on the basis of three main parameters: (not) constraining the two hands by a physical tool, (not) requiring a specific sequence of single-hand gestures, being recursive (or not). In the best performing combination of modeling approach and classification technique, we achieve overall accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score above 80%.","tags":["software architecture"],"title":"Detection of bimanual gestures everywhere: why it matters, what we need and what is missing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Robot Design for Dexterous Manipulation.
