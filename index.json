Dexterity, in simpler term, is the ability to perform a difficult task quickly and skillfully. When it comes to manipulation dexterity, the emphasis is often on design of anthropomorphic hands. However, this doctoral dissertation endeavors in enhancing the wrist and forearm dexterity from a mechanism design perspective. Light weight design, backdrivability and high payload-to-weight ratio form essential characteristics of a dexterous robotic arm. These objectives can be achieved by reducing inertial loads on the arm by relocating the distal actuators to the proximal links and transmitting power through parallel linkages or tendons. This thesis explores state-of-the-art parallel architectures for wrist implementations. It presents a detailed comparison analyses for promising candidate mechanisms considering their workspace parameters and mechanism isotropy. Based on this study, a two degrees of freedom parallel orientational mechanism is proposed for wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation. This mechanism has hemispherical workspace, high range of motion, near to full isotropic behavior and a compact design; the ideal characteristics for a humanoid wrist. Alternatively, for tendon-based transmissions, one of the critical issues is to have appropriate tendon routing so as to avoid any kinematic couplings. To this effect, a novel constant length tendon routing mechanism through an axial joint is also proposed for forearm pronation/supination. This mechanism produces a decoupled full circle rotation while allowing simultaneous routing for four distal joint tendons. The concept idea, computer-aided design, prototyping and preliminary tests are demonstrated for both the wrist and forearm mechanisms that aim towards enhancing humanoid dexterity.","tags":["parallel kinematic mechanisms","computer-aided design","humanoids","tendon-driven mechanisms","dexterous manipulation"],"title":"Design of Wrist and Forearm Mechanisms for Enhanced Humanoid Dexterity","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"IEEE ICRA Workshop on Parallel robots or not parallel robots?

For this, several Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKMs) were considered, namely a 4-UU mechanism, a spherical 5-bar mechanism and a spherical 6-bar mechanism, with gimbal-like rotations. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) modelling and simulations exploring the workspaces for each of these mechanisms was performed. The complete workspace and isotropy analyses comparing these mechanisms to a gimbal system are presented. The general observations suggest that these mechanisms posses a non-uniform workspace with a \"warping\" behaviour. However, the spherical six bar mechanism proves to be the best solution so far with isotropy nearly \u003e= 0.9 throughout its workspace.","tags":["parallel kinematic mechanisms","computer-aided design","humanoids"],"title":"Comparison of Workspace Analysis for Different Spherical Parallel Mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE) 2018 Presented the reasearch work on Workspace Analysis and the effect of Geometric Parameters on the Parallel Mechanisms of the N-UU Class published in this conference.\nCheck out the publication here: ASME-IDETC-2018.

These characteristics make them ideal for applications in robot wrists. This article presents the detailed kinematic and workspace analysis for four N-UU class mechanisms. More in detail, the equations defining the mechanism‚Äôs moving platform kinematics are derived as a function of the motion of the input links; these are then used to explore the mechanism‚Äôs workspace. These results are furthermore validated by comparing them to the results obtained from CAD-based simulations. The analyses suggests that the workspace of the mechanism is non-uniform, with a ‚Äúwarping‚Äù behaviour that occurs in an asymmetric fashion in a specific region of the workspace. Furthermore we show how the rotation of the input links, which mainly actuates the yaw and pitch angles of the mechanism, also causes unwanted coupled rotations along the roll axis.","tags":["parallel kinematic mechanisms","computer-aided design","humanoids"],"title":"Workspace Analysis and the Effect of Geometric Parameters on Parallel Mechanisms of the N-UU Class","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Divya Shah","Ernesto Denicia","Tiago Pimentel","Barbara Bruno","Fulvio Mastrogiovanni"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to copy the citation text.

A reliable detection of bimanual gestures in unconstrained environments is fundamental for their clinical study and to assess common activities of daily living. This paper investigates techniques for a reliable, unconstrained detection and classification of bimanual gestures. The work assumes the availability of inertial data originating from the two hands arms, builds upon a previously developed technique for gesture modeling based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), and compares different modeling and classification techniques, which are based on a number of assumptions inspired by literature about how bimanual gestures are represented and modeled in the brain. Experiments show results related to 5 everyday bimanual activities, which have been selected on the basis of three main parameters: (not) constraining the two hands by a physical tool, (not) requiring a specific sequence of single-hand gestures, being recursive (or not). In the best performing combination of modeling approach and classification technique, we achieve overall accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score above 80%.","tags":["software architecture"],"title":"Detection of bimanual gestures everywhere: why it matters, what we need and what is missing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Divya Shah","Jiuchun Gao","Anatol Pashkevich","St√©phane Caro","Beno√Æt Courtemanche"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to copy the citation text.

They are therefore being extensively used in various industrial sectors, especially aerospace and automotive industries. The traditional methods of fabrication by manual tape laying are labour intensive, time consuming and less efficient. To overcome these drawbacks and to keep up with the growing competitiveness, the enterprises look towards Automated Tape Winding for manufacturing composite components. Automated Tape Winding is a fabrication process in which the workpiece liner is mounted on a rotating mandrel and heated fibre tows are consolidated over it with a compaction roller mounted, on an industrial manipulator. The robotic cell, comprising of a 6-axis robot and an actuated positioner, is kinematically redundant with respect to the considered task of tape winding. To exploit this redundancy to its full potential and to compensate for high raw material costs of composites, it is essential to optimize the tape winding process. This master thesis work, completed within the framework of EMARO+, proposes a comprehensive methodology for optimizing the robot and the positioner trajectories with improved kinematic redundancy management. This work was realized in collaboration with the industrial partner CETIM's technological platform named, SPIDE-TP Platform, with the ultimate aim of the increasing the overall productivity of an Automated Tape Winding process. In this work, the industrial platform was modelled in a CAD environment. The robot and positioner motions were optimized by following a graph-based search using dynamic programming and complemented with intensive collision detection on the CAD model. The simulation results promise to reduce the processing time by one-third.","tags":["parallel kinematic mechanisms","computer-aided design","humanoids"],"title":"Increased Productivity of an Automated Tape Winding Process: SPIDE-TP Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Increased Productivity of an Automated Tape Winding System - SPIDE TP Platform This was the master thesis project during the graduate study with Laboratoire des Sciences du Num√©rique de Nantes (LS2N) at √âcole Centrale de Nantes, France.
